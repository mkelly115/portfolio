# Advanced CSS: Week 2 Portfolio 

The purpose of this application is to showcase some of our current projects as well as shown our understanding of more advanced CSS and the use of flex-boxes. The project will showcase anchor tags to move to each section of the project, as well as links tied to .png files that will bring the user to the selected project. The application will also provide the user with contact information for the creator. Finally the application will be able to act responsive to different devices and stay readable and usable when on a browser or on mobile.
## Usage

The usage of this application is fairly straight forward. The user can click a link at the top of the screen for "About Me", "Projects", or "Contact" and be brought to that section of the portfolio. The user can also click any image of particular portfolio projects and be brought directly to its individual live page. Finally the user can click the email or Github link to either be directed to an e-mail message or be brought to the creators GitHub main page.

## Conclusion

I am coming back to this project much later in the course than planned. It was obviously going to be a bit easier given everything we have gone through since week 2. I will take this time to reflect on how much I have grown as a developer and learned not only innately how to use CSS but how to easily search what I am looking for when trying to troubleshoot problems. Overall, I think returning to this so late in the course has shown me how much I have grown and how much more there is to know. When I was in week 2 initially I hated the idea of CSS and understanding how it worked gave me much stress, months later this outlook has changed and I find the tweaking of CSS to be en excercise that is relaxing and fairly intuitive. Overall this project was a good look at how much knowledge can be gained in a mere 3 months and gives me a strong outlook on just how much more I can learn in the years of development to come.
